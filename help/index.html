  <h1>Help Me Reunite with My Girlfriend in North Carolina üíñ‚úàÔ∏è</h1>

  <p>hey there, i‚Äôm returning to switzerland on the <strong>29th of july</strong> after spending 3 amazing months with my girlfriend in north carolina. but this isn‚Äôt just a vacation ending ‚Äî it‚Äôs a complicated situation.</p>

  <p>me and her met back in <strong>november</strong> when i was looking for a good isle community/server. we quickly became friends and stayed close until around 6 months later, when i wanted to ask her out ‚Äî turned out we both had crushes on each other :D We were in a long distance (US - Switzerland) relationship for <strong>over a year</strong> and really made it work.</p>

  <p>but then 3 months ago, i got a notice that i had to vacade my apartment before <strong>april 29th</strong>. (it was in talks for a long time.) i‚Äôm autistic and depressed, and the support system i was in didn‚Äôt actually want to work with autistic people. i tried to find a new place to stay, but most other support systems that supported autistic + depressed people were either full or just didn‚Äôt want to work with people like me.</p>

  <p>so my girlfriend took her saved-up pennies together and bought me a flight to the US so i could stay with her. i didn‚Äôt have enough time to get a visa (wait time was like 1 month+), so i had to use a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html" target="_blank">ESTA</a> instead.</p>

  <p>now those 3 months are up and i‚Äôm flying back to switzerland on <strong>july 29th</strong>. but i don‚Äôt have a place to stay there except at a friend‚Äôs for a bit, and i want to return to my gf as soon as i can. i‚Äôm already working on getting a visa (and if that fails i‚Äôll try the esta again), but i mostly need help covering the cost for the <strong>flight back to the US</strong>.</p>

  <p>so yeah, if you wanna help keep two people who really love each other together ‚Äî and support someone just trying to find a stable place to exist ‚Äî any donation would mean the world to me and to us.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 1.2em;">üíô thank you for reading and caring!</p>

  <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">FAQ</h2>

    <p><strong>What kind of visa are you applying for?</strong><br>
    i plan on getting a work visa so i can start working and helping her out financially</p>

    <p><strong>Is there a deadline to return to NC?</strong><br>
    not exactly, my best friend said i could stay at this place for at least 3 months, so that‚Äôs plenty of time (assuming i get accepted) for either a visa or a esta again</p>

    <p><strong>What will donations be used for?</strong><br>
    purely for flight ticket, visa and if we reach our goal (of about $1200, assuming it‚Äôs around that since the flights are very pricey) for food (will be publicly shown how much the ticket etc cost and how we used the money)</p>

    <p><strong>What happens if you can‚Äôt get back?</strong><br>
    i will have to request financial support again and find a new shared apartment, or temporarily have to go into a homeless shelter or mental hospital with limited/no internet access.</p>

    <p><strong>Will you track donations publicly?</strong><br>
    yes, we‚Äôll put all donations into this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fi6Y9nRRD5XR6aXGVCpPvPx5XOOauYQpIWvxuX8hV0s/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">google spreadsheet</a> (no names unless u want to be mentioned)</p>
